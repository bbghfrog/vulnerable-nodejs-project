## Critical Action Required

⚠️ **The following credentials were exposed in the codebase and MUST be rotated immediately:**

1. GitHub Token: `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`
2. API Key: `zaCELgL.0imfnc8mVLWwsAawjYr4Rx-Af50DDqtlx`
3. Slack Bot Token: `xoxb-1234567890-DUMMYSlackBotToken1234567890abc`
4. GitLab Token: `glpat-QXnC`

**Actions to take:**
- Revoke all exposed tokens immediately
- Generate new secure credentials
- Update `.env` file with new credentials
- Review access logs for unauthorized usage

## Recommendations for Ongoing Security

1. **Enable automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Enable GitHub Dependabot** for automatic dependency updates
3. **Never commit `.env` files** or secrets to the repository
4. **Run `npm audit` regularly** to check for new vulnerabilities
5. **Use a secrets management service** (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.)
6. **Implement security headers** with helmet.js middleware
7. **Add rate limiting** to prevent DoS attacks
8. **Implement input validation** and sanitization
9. **Enable GitHub security alerts** for this repository
10. **Conduct regular security audits**
